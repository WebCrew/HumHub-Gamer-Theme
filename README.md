#  HumHub-Theme-TodGmbH

I did a lot of changes and fixed a lot of issues and bugs. 
Theme is working nice with latest HumHub release! Version 1.0.1+

!!Your help is urgently wanted to fix some of the few little bugs which are maybe left.


NOTE: 
_The theme needs one Space which is open also for guests, otherwise the login/registration is not working! I will not change that feature, because thats the way my theme has to work, but you are welcome to edit it in your installation to fit your needs._
